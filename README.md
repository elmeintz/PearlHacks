Welcome to our resume grader!

You need to have the following dependencies:
pandoc
pypandoc
openai
Python 3

After each time you run the resume grader, you need to delete all of the files it saved to the folder you are locally in. They should have names in the format "resumedoc0.txt" where the 0 can be replaced with other integers. All resumes you want to grade should be in the same folder as where you are calling this program.
